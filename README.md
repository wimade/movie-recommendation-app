# movie-recommendation-app
To build an app that recommends movies and also store user ratings.

Project Overview
If you have a good command of the basic concepts of React and want to take your skills a step further, this project is for you.

Create an app that recommends movies to users based on their personal preferences. Whenever users sign up for the app, you can ask a set of questions from users to get all the necessary information needed by the app to understand what kind of movies they like the most. Examples of this include genres, directors, actors, and the latest.

The users can also search for movies, give ratings, and view a particular movie's overall rating. Capture and utilize the interaction data to make the movie recommendations more accurate and relevant.

As this app will focus on user engagement, you must think critically while designing its UI and UX. To make things even more serious, you can add a user system so that users donâ€™t have to set their preferences every time they open the app; instead, only the first time before registering as a user.

While working on this app, you will also be able to enhance your database management skills. You have to focus on gathering data from app users and processing the data to deliver better recommendations.
