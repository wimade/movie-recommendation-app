# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# movie-recommendation-app
To build an app that recommends movies and also store user ratings.

Project Overview
If you have a good command of the basic concepts of React and want to take your skills a step further, this project is for you.

Create an app that recommends movies to users based on their personal preferences. Whenever users sign up for the app, you can ask a set of questions from users to get all the necessary information needed by the app to understand what kind of movies they like the most. Examples of this include genres, directors, actors, and the latest.

The users can also search for movies, give ratings, and view a particular movie's overall rating. Capture and utilize the interaction data to make the movie recommendations more accurate and relevant.

As this app will focus on user engagement, you must think critically while designing its UI and UX. To make things even more serious, you can add a user system so that users donâ€™t have to set their preferences every time they open the app; instead, only the first time before registering as a user.

While working on this app, you will also be able to enhance your database management skills. You have to focus on gathering data from app users and processing the data to deliver better recommendations.
